### Welcome to Tandem Plants
#### By Munaiz Ahmed


Hi Tandem !

For the apprenticship code challenge I created a web application using 'create-react-app' & its really easy to use!
The full list of dependancies can be viewed in package.json, but the two major dependancies used are :
- react.js
- moment.js

I used react to build the user interface of the web app as well as to render the dates where each
plant needs watering.

Moment.js was used for date manipulation, and was crucial for the logic that drives the app.


Once you've forked and downloaded the respository, you should cd into the directory and:
1. npm install
2. npm start


## npm start

npm start opens the the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
